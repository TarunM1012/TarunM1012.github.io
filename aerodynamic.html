        <h2>Aerodynamic Tuning</h2>
        
        <p>
            Aerodynamic tuning references to the phycial body changes of the car. All apects of a car including the splitter, ride height, spoiler angle, fender flares, and even diffusers in some car, 
            can affect handling, speed and safety. Race teams use wind tunnels and other facilites to test airflow in and around a car. Ride height plays a crucial role in the drag of a car. 
            A lower front splitter would lower air pressure, increasing downforce. However due to the unevenness of racetracks, this could be quite dangerous. On the other hand, too much ride height would cause more 
            air to go underneath the ar and reduce spead, with less downforce. In NASCAR, aerodynamic play a unique role. Unlike mechanical settings, they cannot be changed on the fly so notes are essential. 
            NASCAR race cars rely on drafting to keep up and pass cars. While drafting, cars reach speeds up 200 mph. Not having safety precautions such as hood and roof flaps could cause a fatal accident. Cars can also 
            gain an advantagle by having a setup that could increase sideforce, gaining the ability to manipulate the aerodyanamic of other cars without even touching them.

            Adjustments related to suspension:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Wing/Spoiler angle</b> - Angle at which the soiler or wing is oriented. Increases or reduce downforce which affects cornering ability.</li>
            <li><b>Fender Flares</b> - Part of the fender or wheel well that stiks out past the rest of the car to inrease side force and manueverability.</li>
            <li><b>Drafting</b> - Using cars in the front as an air barrier, increasing speeds to stay with and pass cars.</li>
            <li><b>Front splitter/ride height</b> -  Height of the front and rear the car relative to the ground. Essential for downforce, handling, and speed.</li>
        </ul>
